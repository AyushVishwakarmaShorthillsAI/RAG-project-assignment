RAG-LLM Q&A System Documentation
Project Overview
The RAG-LLM Q&A System is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to answer questions by retrieving relevant information from a diverse set of web pages and generating responses using a language model. The system scrapes data from 100–500 web pages, supports at least 1000 Q&A interactions, and includes a Streamlit UI for user interaction. It follows a modular, object-oriented design with plug-and-play flexibility, allowing easy swapping of components like vector databases and LLMs.
Use Case

Objective: Scrape data from legitimate websites and perform Q&A using a RAG-LLM model.
Data Sources: A variety of websites, including Wikipedia (scientific and historical topics), NASA (space-related content), and other educational/government sites (e.g., educational blogs, research institutions).
LLM Choice: Uses OllamaLLM by default, with flexibility to swap for models like LLaMA or OpenAI models.

Requirements

Documentation: Thoroughly documented (this document).
Project Scale: Scrapes 100–500 web pages (verified in logs).
Evaluation: Supports 1000+ Q&A interactions with 1000+ test cases.
General Rules:
Modular, object-oriented code with base/derived classes.
Plug-and-play design for components.
Comprehensive logging of Q&A sessions and user interactions.
