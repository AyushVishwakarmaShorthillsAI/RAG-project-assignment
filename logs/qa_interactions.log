{"question": "what is photosyntheis", "answer": "Photosynthesis is the biological process of synthesizing complex carbon compounds from carbonic acid in the presence of chlorophyll and light energy."}
{"question": "what is photosynthesis", "answer": "Photosynthesis is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms convert light energy into chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism."}
{"question": "what is Black hole", "answer": "A black hole is a massive, compact astronomical object so dense that its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light."}
{"question": "What is DNA and what is its function in living organisms?", "answer": "According to the context, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. It carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses."}
{"question": "What is Photosynthesis", "answer": "According to the context, Photosynthesis is \"a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism.\""}
{"question": "What are the fundamental principles of thermodynamics?", "answer": "The fundamental principles of thermodynamics are the four laws of thermodynamics, which govern the behavior of heat, work, and temperature, as well as energy, entropy, and physical properties of matter and radiation. These laws provide a quantitative description of macroscopic physical quantities that can be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics."}
{"question": "What is the role of DNA in genetic inheritance?", "answer": "According to the context, the structure of DNA serves as the physical basis for inheritance, allowing for the replication of genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand. This redundant information enables the transmission of traits from one generation to the next."}
{"question": "Describe the person who developed theory of relativity", "answer": "According to the context, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity. Specifically, he published the theory of special relativity in 1905 and later developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by others after 1915."}
{"question": "who firstly discovered the black hole?", "answer": "According to the context, there is no single person credited with the discovery of the first black hole. Instead, several researchers independently identified Cygnus X-1 as a black hole candidate in 1971."}
{"question": "af", "answer": "I'm ready!\n\nWhat's the question?"}
